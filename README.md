# superlumenworkshop

This is from a workshop at Superlumen for learning Redux. 
Here created a simple counter to learn the skeleton structure of how Redux works.
We learned about Actions, which are called by dispatchers, and the reducers take the current state and the action to calculate the new state. 
We learned about general syntax and the pros and cons of Redux.
